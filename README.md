# Recommendations
**1. Address Competition :**
- Focus on understanding why customers are switching to competitors, especially in cities like San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.
- Develop targeted retention strategies, such as loyalty programs or exclusive offers, to counteract competitor influence.

**2. Improve Payment Options :**
- Encourage customers to switch from mailed checks and bank withdrawals to credit cards, as credit card users have a significantly lower churn rate.
- Offer incentives for customers who adopt more convenient payment methods.

**3. Target Younger Demographics :**
- Leverage the high join rate among younger customers (20-30 age range) by creating tailored marketing campaigns and promotions.

**4. Optimize Promotional Offers :**
- Consider offering more attractive deals to customers who are not currently enrolled in any promotional offers.
